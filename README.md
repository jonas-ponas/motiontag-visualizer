# motiontag-visualizer

## Visualizer 

This little application visualizes the csv file you receive, when you request your personal information of [Motion-Tag](https://motiontag.com/).
It currently visualizes the paths you tracked in a simple map view.

All data handling happens in your browser. Therefore you can also use the deployed version at github pages.

### Development

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager.
Use `pnpm serve` to start a local server with auto-refresh. 

## Downloader

A CLI program in Rust, to download your data directly from Motion-Tags API. The API was reverse-engineered from the app, so use this at your own risk.
